  "interactions_notes": "May interact with medications affecting growth hormone, cortisol, or prolactin. Can cause desensitization with continuous use. Comprehensive endocrine evaluation recommended before use.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Research protocols have used doses ranging from 100-200 mcg administered 1-2 times daily. Cycling protocols often recommended due to desensitization concerns.",
