  "category_tags": ["growth", "recovery", "metabolic"],
  "typical_route": ["subQ", "IM"],
  "overview": "A synthetic hexapeptide that stimulates growth hormone release from the pituitary gland. It is a second-generation growth hormone secretagogue with less hunger stimulation than GHRP-6.",
  "what_people_seek": ["growth hormone optimization", "recovery support", "body composition", "sleep quality"],
  "evidence_level": "Moderate",
  "risk_level": "Moderate",
  "side_effects_common": ["water retention", "increased hunger (less than GHRP-6)", "tingling or numbness", "fatigue", "elevated cortisol (transient)"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "active cancer or tumor history", "uncontrolled diabetes", "severe illness requiring hospitalization"],
  "interactions_notes": "May interact with medications affecting growth hormone or blood glucose. Can transiently increase cortisol and prolactin. Consult clinician if taking diabetes medications or corticosteroids.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Research protocols have used doses ranging from 100-300 mcg administered 1-3 times daily, typically on an empty stomach.",

    "example_doses_mg": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
  },
  "storage_notes": "Store unreconstituted peptide in freezer (-20°C or colder). After reconstitution with bacteriostatic water, store refrigerated and use within 2-3 weeks.",
