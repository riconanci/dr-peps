  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "liver disease or impaired liver function", "metabolic disorders without clinician oversight"],
  "interactions_notes": "Very limited interaction data. May affect methylation and NAD+ pathways. Discuss with clinician if taking niacin supplements, NAD+ boosters, or medications affecting liver metabolism.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Human clinical data is extremely limited. Animal research has explored various doses. Anecdotal protocols range widely with no established standard.",
