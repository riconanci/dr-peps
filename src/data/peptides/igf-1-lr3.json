  "aliases": ["Long R3 IGF-I", "Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Long R3"],
  "category_tags": ["growth", "recovery", "metabolic"],
  "typical_route": ["subQ", "IM"],
  "overview": "A modified version of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) with amino acid substitutions that extend its half-life and reduce binding to IGF binding proteins. It has a significantly longer duration of action than native IGF-1.",
  "what_people_seek": ["muscle growth support", "recovery enhancement", "protein synthesis", "cellular growth"],
  "evidence_level": "Preliminary",
  "risk_level": "High",
  "side_effects_common": ["hypoglycemia risk", "jaw pain", "headache", "joint discomfort", "organ growth concerns with prolonged use"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "active malignancy or cancer history", "diabetic retinopathy", "severe hypoglycemia risk", "adolescents with open growth plates without medical supervision"],
  "interactions_notes": "Significant risk of hypoglycemia, especially with diabetes medications or insulin. May interact with growth hormone therapies. Requires close monitoring of blood glucose. Comprehensive endocrine evaluation essential before use.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Research has explored a wide range from 20-100 mcg per day, typically split into multiple doses. Human clinical data is very limited and dosing is not standardized.",
  "reconstitution": {
    "vial_total_mg": 1,

  "storage_notes": "Store unreconstituted peptide in freezer (-20°C or colder). After reconstitution, store refrigerated and use within 1-2 weeks. Highly sensitive to temperature and pH.",
