  "aliases": ["BPC/TB Combo", "Recovery Stack"],
  "category_tags": ["recovery", "joints & tendons", "gut"],
  "typical_route": ["subQ"],
  "overview": "A popular combination of BPC-157 and TB-500 used together for synergistic effects on tissue repair and recovery. Many protocols combine these peptides based on their complementary mechanisms - BPC-157 for localized healing and TB-500 for systemic recovery support.",
  "what_people_seek": ["enhanced recovery", "joint and tendon support", "combined tissue repair", "injury rehabilitation", "gut and systemic healing"],
  "evidence_level": "Preliminary",
  "risk_level": "Unknown",
  "side_effects_common": ["injection site reactions", "digestion changes", "headache", "lightheadedness", "fatigue (rare)", "potential interactions between compounds"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "active malignancy or history of hormone-sensitive cancers", "significant uncontrolled illness", "those who should avoid either individual peptide"],
  "interactions_notes": "Limited data on combination interactions. May have additive effects. Review medications and supplements with clinician. If either individual peptide is contraindicated, the combination should be avoided.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Common protocols combine BPC-157 (250-500 mcg) with TB-500 (2-5 mg) administered together or separately. Frequency varies from daily to 2-3 times per week. Some protocols alternate peptides. Clinical guidance is essential as dosing is not standardized.",
  "reconstitution": {
    "vial_total_mg": 7,
    "common_diluents_ml": [2, 3],
    "example_doses_mg": [0.5, 1, 2]
  },
  "storage_notes": "Store unreconstituted peptides in freezer (-20°C or colder). After reconstitution with bacteriostatic water, store refrigerated and use within 2-3 weeks. May be mixed in same syringe or administered separately.",
