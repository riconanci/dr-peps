  "category_tags": ["skin"],
  "typical_route": ["topical"],
  "overview": "A synthetic hexapeptide designed for topical cosmetic use, often marketed as a non-invasive alternative to botulinum toxin injections. It is formulated into skincare products and works by potentially reducing the depth of wrinkles caused by facial muscle contractions.",
  "what_people_seek": ["wrinkle reduction", "anti-aging skincare", "non-invasive facial rejuvenation", "expression line softening", "topical alternative to injections"],
  "evidence_level": "Moderate",
  "risk_level": "Low",
  "side_effects_common": ["skin irritation (rare)", "mild redness", "dryness", "sensitivity at application site", "allergic reactions (uncommon)"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding (as a precaution)", "known allergies to cosmetic peptides", "compromised skin barrier or open wounds", "active skin infections"],
  "interactions_notes": "Generally well-tolerated in cosmetic formulations. May interact with other active skincare ingredients like retinoids or exfoliants. Patch testing recommended when combining with new products.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Topical cosmetic products typically contain argireline at concentrations of 5-10%. Applied as directed by product formulation, usually once or twice daily to target areas. Injectable forms exist but are less common than topical use.",
