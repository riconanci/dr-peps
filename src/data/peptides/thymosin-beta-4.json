  "aliases": ["Tβ4", "TB4", "Thymosin β4"],
  "category_tags": ["recovery", "joints & tendons"],
  "typical_route": ["subQ", "IM"],
  "overview": "A naturally occurring 43-amino acid peptide present in high concentrations in blood platelets, wound fluid, and many tissues. It plays a role in tissue repair, wound healing, and inflammation regulation. TB-500 is its better-known synthetic counterpart used in research and clinical settings.",
  "what_people_seek": ["tissue repair support", "wound healing", "injury recovery", "joint and tendon health", "anti-inflammatory effects"],
  "evidence_level": "Moderate",
  "risk_level": "Unknown",
  "side_effects_common": ["injection site reactions (redness, swelling)", "headache", "fatigue", "nausea", "temporary soreness"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "active cancer or cancer history without oncologist approval", "severe autoimmune conditions without medical supervision", "known allergies to thymosin peptides"],
  "interactions_notes": "Interactions are not well-documented. May affect immune response and tissue healing. Comprehensive discussion with healthcare provider required, especially for those on immunosuppressive therapy or anticoagulants.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Research protocols have varied from 2-10 mg per injection, administered 1-2 times weekly. The synthetic version (TB-500) is more commonly discussed in practice. Clinical dosing standards for the natural peptide are not established.",
  "reconstitution": {
    "vial_total_mg": 5,
    "common_diluents_ml": [1, 2],
    "example_doses_mg": [2, 5, 10]
  },
  "storage_notes": "Store unreconstituted peptide in freezer (-20°C or colder). After reconstitution, store refrigerated at 2-8°C and use within the timeframe specified by supplier (typically 2-4 weeks). Protect from light.",
