  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "copper metabolism disorders (Wilson's disease)", "copper allergies or sensitivities"],
  "interactions_notes": "May interact with copper supplements or medications affecting copper metabolism. Generally well-tolerated topically. Discuss with clinician if using other copper-containing products.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Topical formulations typically use 0.05-2% concentrations. Subcutaneous injection protocols in research have varied from 1-10 mg, but topical use is more common and established.",
