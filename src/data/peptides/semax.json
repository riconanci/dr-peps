  "category_tags": ["cognitive", "recovery"],
  "typical_route": ["nasal", "subQ"],
  "overview": "A synthetic peptide developed in Russia based on a fragment of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). It has been approved in Russia as a nootropic and neuroprotective agent, though it remains experimental in most other countries.",
  "what_people_seek": ["cognitive enhancement", "focus and memory", "neuroprotection", "mental clarity"],
  "evidence_level": "Anecdotal",
  "risk_level": "Unknown",
  "side_effects_common": ["nasal irritation (nasal form)", "headache", "restlessness or overstimulation", "changes in sleep patterns"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "severe mental health conditions without medical oversight", "individuals with anxiety disorders", "cardiovascular conditions without clearance"],
  "interactions_notes": "Limited interaction data outside of Russian research. May interact with stimulants, nootropics, and psychiatric medications. May affect stress hormone pathways.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Russian protocols use nasal administration of 0.5-1 mg per day divided into 2-3 doses. Various concentrations exist (0.1%, 1%). Western clinical validation is lacking.",
  "reconstitution": {
    "vial_total_mg": 5,

    "example_doses_mg": [0.3, 0.6, 1]
  },
  "storage_notes": "Store unreconstituted peptide in freezer (-20°C or colder). After reconstitution, store refrigerated and use within 2-3 weeks. Nasal formulations may have different storage requirements.",
