  "aliases": ["Advanced Obesity Drug", "Tyr-hGH Fragment 177-191"],
  "category_tags": ["weight", "metabolic"],
  "typical_route": ["subQ"],
  "overview": "A modified fragment of human growth hormone (amino acids 176-191) that was developed to retain the fat-reducing effects of HGH without the growth-promoting effects. Research has explored its potential for fat metabolism without affecting blood sugar or tissue growth.",
  "what_people_seek": ["fat metabolism support", "body composition", "weight management"],
  "evidence_level": "Moderate",
  "risk_level": "Low",
  "side_effects_common": ["injection site reactions", "mild headache", "temporary fatigue", "lightheadedness"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "active malignancy", "severe illness requiring hospitalization", "individuals with metabolic disorders without clinician oversight"],
  "interactions_notes": "Limited interaction data available. May affect fat metabolism. Discuss with clinician if taking diabetes medications, thyroid medications, or other weight management therapies.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Clinical studies have explored doses ranging from 250-500 mcg administered once or twice daily, typically on an empty stomach in the morning and/or before exercise.",
  "reconstitution": {
    "vial_total_mg": 5,

    "example_doses_mg": [0.25, 0.5]
  },
  "storage_notes": "Store unreconstituted peptide in freezer (-20°C or colder). After reconstitution with bacteriostatic water, store refrigerated and use within 2-3 weeks.",
