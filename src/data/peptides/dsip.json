  "overview": "A neuropeptide first isolated in the 1970s from rabbits in delta-wave sleep. Research has explored its effects on sleep regulation and stress response, though human clinical data remains limited.",
  "what_people_seek": ["sleep quality", "stress management", "recovery support", "circadian rhythm regulation"],
  "evidence_level": "Preliminary",
  "risk_level": "Unknown",
  "side_effects_common": ["drowsiness", "injection site reactions", "vivid dreams", "grogginess upon waking"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "severe sleep disorders without sleep specialist guidance", "individuals operating heavy machinery", "psychiatric conditions without medical oversight"],
  "interactions_notes": "Limited interaction data. May interact with sleep medications, sedatives, anxiolytics, and alcohol. May affect stress hormone regulation. Avoid driving or operating machinery after use.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Research protocols have explored doses ranging from 1-5 mg administered before bedtime. Human clinical studies are limited and protocols vary significantly.",

    "common_diluents_ml": [2],
    "example_doses_mg": [1, 2]
  },
  "storage_notes": "Store unreconstituted peptide in freezer (-20°C or colder). After reconstitution with bacteriostatic water, store refrigerated and use within 2-3 weeks.",
