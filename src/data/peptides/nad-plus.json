  "overview": "NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a coenzyme found in all living cells, not technically a peptide. It plays a crucial role in cellular energy production, DNA repair, and numerous metabolic processes. NAD+ levels naturally decline with age.",
  "what_people_seek": ["cellular energy optimization", "anti-aging support", "metabolic health", "cognitive function", "DNA repair support", "mitochondrial function"],
  "evidence_level": "Moderate",
  "risk_level": "Low",
  "side_effects_common": ["flushing or warmth", "nausea (especially IV/IM)", "cramping or discomfort during IV infusion", "headache", "fatigue (transient)", "injection site reactions"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "active malignancy without oncology clearance", "severe kidney or liver disease", "known hypersensitivity to niacin or NAD+ compounds"],
  "interactions_notes": "May interact with medications affecting liver metabolism. Can interact with blood pressure medications. May affect glucose metabolism - caution with diabetes medications. Discuss all supplements and medications with clinician.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Oral NAD+ precursors (NMN, NR) typically use 250-1000 mg daily. Injectable NAD+ protocols vary widely from 25-100 mg subcutaneous to 250-1000 mg IV infusions. IV infusions are typically administered slowly over 2-4 hours to minimize side effects.",

    "common_diluents_ml": [10, 20],
    "example_doses_mg": [25, 50, 100]
  },
  "storage_notes": "Store unreconstituted NAD+ powder refrigerated at 2-8°C, protected from light. After reconstitution with sterile saline or sterile water, use immediately or store refrigerated for up to 24 hours. IV formulations may have different requirements.",
