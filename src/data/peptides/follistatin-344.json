  "overview": "A naturally occurring protein that binds to and inhibits myostatin, a protein that limits muscle growth. Research has explored its potential role in muscle development and metabolic regulation.",

  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "active malignancy or cancer history", "hormone-sensitive conditions", "adolescents with open growth plates"],
  "interactions_notes": "Very limited interaction data. May affect muscle and metabolic pathways. Comprehensive endocrine evaluation essential. Unknown interactions with anabolic agents.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Human clinical data is extremely limited. Animal research has used varying protocols. No standardized human dosing exists. Gene therapy approaches have also been explored.",
