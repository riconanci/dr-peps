  "overview": "A modified fragment of human growth hormone (amino acids 176-191) that was researched for its potential fat-reducing effects without the growth-promoting properties of full HGH. Closely related to AOD-9604.",

  "evidence_level": "Preliminary",
  "risk_level": "Low",
  "side_effects_common": ["injection site reactions", "mild headache", "lightheadedness", "temporary fatigue"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "active malignancy", "severe metabolic disorders without medical supervision"],
  "interactions_notes": "Limited interaction data. May affect fat metabolism. Discuss with clinician if taking diabetes medications, thyroid medications, or other metabolic therapies.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Research protocols have explored doses ranging from 250-500 mcg administered once or twice daily, typically on an empty stomach before exercise or in the morning.",
