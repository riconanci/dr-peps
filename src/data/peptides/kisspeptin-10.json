  "category_tags": ["libido", "metabolic"],
  "typical_route": ["subQ", "IM"],
  "overview": "A peptide hormone that plays a critical role in regulating reproductive hormone secretion, particularly in triggering GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) release. Research has explored its role in fertility and sexual function.",
  "what_people_seek": ["reproductive hormone support", "libido enhancement", "fertility support", "hypothalamic-pituitary axis optimization"],
  "evidence_level": "Preliminary",
  "risk_level": "Unknown",
  "side_effects_common": ["injection site reactions", "hot flashes", "headache", "nausea", "changes in mood"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "hormone-sensitive cancers", "individuals with reproductive disorders without endocrine specialist guidance", "adolescents without medical supervision"],
  "interactions_notes": "Very limited interaction data. May affect reproductive hormones including LH, FSH, and sex hormones. Comprehensive endocrine evaluation essential before use. May interact with hormonal therapies.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Clinical research has explored intravenous doses in the microgram range for studying reproductive function. Subcutaneous protocols are less established. Human data is limited.",
