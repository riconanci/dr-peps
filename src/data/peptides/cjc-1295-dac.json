  "category_tags": ["growth", "recovery", "metabolic"],
  "typical_route": ["subQ"],
  "overview": "A modified growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) analog with an added Drug Affinity Complex (DAC) that extends its half-life. This allows for less frequent dosing compared to standard CJC-1295.",

  "evidence_level": "Moderate",
  "risk_level": "Moderate",
  "side_effects_common": ["injection site reactions", "headache", "flushing", "dizziness", "fatigue", "water retention"],
  "who_should_avoid": ["pregnancy or breastfeeding", "active malignancy or cancer history", "diabetic retinopathy", "severe illness or post-surgical recovery", "hypersensitivity to components"],
  "interactions_notes": "May affect glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Can interact with diabetes medications, thyroid medications, and corticosteroids. Comprehensive medication review with clinician required.",
  "dosing_ranges_literature": "Research protocols have used doses ranging from 0.5-2 mg administered once or twice weekly due to extended half-life from DAC modification.",
